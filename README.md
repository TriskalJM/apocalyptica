## An Apocalypse World 2e Discord Bot. 

[Apocalypse World](http://apocalypse-world.com) is a great game by Vincent Baker. This bot makes playing the game online easier by providing a dice-roller that also outputs the details of a hit or miss:

![Example Usage](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s7t9lx639z03zeb/example.png?)

### Usage
```
!moves - display supported moves (only the basic moves are included)
!!help - display usage

!<move> <bonus> - rolls and displays move results.
```

#### Adding your own moves.  

Add your own moves by modifying basic.json.

### Installation
You will need to use the instructions for setting up a bot in Discord. When you have a token, you can build the code then run it like so:
```
apocalyptica -t <TOKEN>
```
You will then need to invite it to your server.

### Apocalyptica in the wild.

Right now I'm testing a general use server. I'll provide a link to it when it is ready for public use.
